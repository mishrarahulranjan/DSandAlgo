/**
 * Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.
 *
 * From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down.
 * You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).
 * Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
