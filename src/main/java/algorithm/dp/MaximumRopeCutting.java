/**
 * Given a rope of length n meters, cut the rope in different parts of integer lengths in a way
 * that maximizes product of lengths of all parts.
 * You must make at least one cut. Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters.
 * Examples:
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 1 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*1)
 *
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 2 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*2)
