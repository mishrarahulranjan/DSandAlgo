/**
 * You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i),
 * width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes
 * which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box
 * if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box.
 * Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base.
 * It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
 * Output: 190
 * Explanation:
 * Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
 * Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
 * Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.
 * The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.
